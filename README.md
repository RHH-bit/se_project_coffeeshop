project name
Coffee Shop Web Page

project description
some of the things i used when making this web page are anchor tags, animation, keyframes, forms, and iframe to name a few.

plans for improvement
as you can see their is a place to reserve a table i think it would be a good idea to add a way to order off the menu right on the webpage or adding a new page for ordering when you are at the library that the coffee shop is located in.
